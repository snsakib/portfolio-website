  <p>May peace be upon you!</p>

  <p>
    As speaking of myself, I'm 25; born & raised in Bangladesh; perceptive,
    communicative & adaptive in nature.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since my major was Electrical & Electronics Engineering, people often ask me
    why am I switching career. The truth is, during my sophomore year I started
    learning web developing as a hobby. As days passed by, my curiosity for it
    gradually increased & finally after graduation decided to embrace it as my
    profession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of my professional expertise include developing
    <span class="highlight">Single Page Applications</span> &
    <span class="highlight">Responsive Websites.</span> I am proficient in
    converting <span class="highlight">Prototypes to Pixel Perfect Code</span>.
    I personally prefer to work in
    <span class="highlight">Angular</span> environment but always willing to
    learn & implement new technologies for accomplishing project goals. While
    working in any project I always give priority to
    <span class="highlight">user-experience</span>,
    <span class="highlight">performance</span> &
    <span class="highlight">accessibility.</span>
