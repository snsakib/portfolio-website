    Developing, Testing, Upgrading Myself & Always Will Be
  </p>

  <p>May peace be upon you!</p>

  <p>
    As speaking of myself, I like to lead my life in a simple & ethical way. People often characterize me as an
    introvert but I like to introduce myself as a person who knows when & how to talk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since my major was electrical & electronics engineering, people often ask me why am I switching career. The truth
    is, during my sophomore year I started learning web developing as a hobby. As days passed by, my curiosity for it
    gradually increased & finally 3 years later, after my graduation decided to embrace it as my profession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of my professional expertise include designing & developing single page applications (SPA) & responsive
    websites. I personally prefer to work in Angular environment but willing to learn new technologies for achieving
    the desired output. During any project, I always keep user-experience, performance & accessibility on my top
    priority.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>To refurbish my skills I've already completed some projects. You can browse them <a routerLink="/projects" class="highlight">here.</a></p>

  <p>Though I don't know everything, I feel delighted to teach others what I've learned so far. You can read my blog
    posts <a routerLink="/blog" class="highlight">here.</a></p> -->

  <p>
    Currently <span class="highlight">seeking opportunities as a Jr. frontend web developer</span> in a friendly,
    cooperative workplace where I can implement my skills, learn from my co-workers & gradually evolve myself to become
    more effective & efficient. If you want me in your team then <a mat-flat-button href="mailto:{{ email }}" (click)="openSnackBar()">Hire
