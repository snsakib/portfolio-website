    Developing, Testing, Upgrading Myself & Always Will Be
  </p>

  <p>May peace be upon you!</p>

  <p>
    As speaking of myself, I like to lead my life in a simple & ethical way. I'm
    imperfect in so many ways so constructive criticism is always welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since my major was Electrical & Electronics Engineering, people often ask me
    why am I switching career. The truth is, during my sophomore year I started
    learning web developing as a hobby. As days passed by, my curiosity for it
    gradually increased & finally 3 years later, after my graduation decided to
    embrace it as my profession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of my professional expertise include designing & developing <span class="highlight">Single Page
      Applications & Responsive Websites.</span> I personally prefer to work in the
    <span class="highlight">Angular</span> environment but willing to learn new technologies for achieving the
    desired output. While developing, I try to maintain clean coding practices &
    user-experience, performance, accessibility always gets my top priority.
  </p>

  <p>To refurbish my skills I've already completed some projects. You can browse them <a routerLink="/projects" class="highlight">here.</a></p>

  <!-- <p>Though I don't know everything, I feel delighted to teach others what I've learned so far. You can read my blog
    posts <a routerLink="/blog" class="highlight">here.</a></p> -->

  <p>
    Currently
    <span class="highlight">seeking opportunities as a frontend web developer</span>
    in a friendly, cooperative workplace where I can implement my skills, learn
    from my co-workers & gradually evolve myself to become more effective &
    efficient. If you want me in your team then
