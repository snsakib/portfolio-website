  <p>I never thought of becoming a web developer!</p>

  <p>
    My goal was to study electronics. Therefore, I got myself admitted to EEE.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything was working great until I got stuck in one of my university
    projects where I had to do some coding. Since I didn't write a single line
    of code before, I reluctantly started learning to code.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days later, I discovered myself solving programming problems by
    staying up late at night! There were times when I went to sleep pondering
    over a problem; I woke up in the middle of the night &amp; realized I've
    found the solution!
  </p>

  <p>
    Every day my curiosity grew exponentially. The more I explored the realm of
    programming, the more I wanted to discover.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, it was getting difficult for me to study my university courses and
    programming at the same time. I had to focus on one thing and leave another.
    Though It was very tough to decide, I preferred putting my focus on studying
    programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, I started to skip classes; I failed at examinations; my GPA
    plummeted. It took me 2 years more to complete my graduation! But I never
    regretted my decision.
  </p>

  <p>
    During those days, I gained proficiency in various aspects of front-end web
    development such as Single Page Applications (SPA), Responsive Web Design,
    HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript &amp; Angular.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm highly enthusiastic about JavaScript-based technologies like MEAN Stack
    (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js), NativeScript &amp; Electron.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a huge admirer of online education. I grasp every opportunity to widen
    the scope of my knowledge. I'm currently pursuing "Data Scientist with
    Python" career track at DataCamp.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently seeking opportunities as a "Front-end Web Developer" in a
    workplace that nurtures creativity &amp; provides mentorship to grow within
    the job.
